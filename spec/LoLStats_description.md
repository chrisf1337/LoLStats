# LoLStats Description

LoLStats is an iOS application that tracks and compares the user's statistics in
League of Legends, a popular MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game in
which teams of players compete to accomplish goals in a variety of game
modes. Currently, there exist web applications that track the stats of players,
such as [op.gg](http://op.gg), [LoLKing](http://www.lolking.net), and
[Elophant](http://www.elophant.com). LoLStats aims to largely replicate the
functionality of these sites in a native iOS application while also adding the
capability to track the users' friends' performance and compare his/her own
stats to other players' stats using charts and graphs. In addition, the user may
choose to add other players in a watch list, which allows the user to easily
keep track of other players' performance and presents notifications to the user
if one of the players on the watch list has played a new game.
